# Windows Explorer Context Menu

VSCode extension that opens the Windows Explorer Context Menu.
It is triggered by the *"Windows Explorer Context Menu"* option in the 
context menu of files and folders from the *Explorer* pane.

Of course it only work on Windows.

## Installation

Clone the repository or download and extract the [.zip file](https://github.com/electrotype/vscode-windows-explorer-context-menu/archive/master.zip) in your

I may publish this extension in the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode),
